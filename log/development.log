With blockchain, you don’t need a trusted third-party to oversee or validate transactions."], ["image", "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1487058792275-0ad4aaf24ca7?ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxzZWFyY2h8MTZ8fGJsb2NrY2hhaW58ZW58MHx8MHx8&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&auto=format&fit=crop&w=600&q=60"], ["creation_date", "2021-07-10 00:00:00"], ["user_id", 50], ["category_id", 2], ["created_at", "2021-07-21 22:48:39.696975"], ["updated_at", "2021-07-21 22:48:39.696975"]]
